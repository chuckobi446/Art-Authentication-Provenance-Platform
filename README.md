# ArtChain - Decentralized Art Authentication & Provenance Platform

A blockchain-based platform for authenticating artwork, tracking provenance, and enabling fractional ownership through NFTs and AI-powered verification.

## Overview

ArtChain revolutionizes the art market by providing:
- Immutable provenance records for artworks
- AI-powered forgery detection
- NFT-based ownership certification

- Real-time forgery detection
- Automated authenticity certificates

### NFT Certification
- Dual-token system (physical art representation + fractional shares)
- High-resolution digital asset storage
- Multi-signature ownership transfer
- Smart contract-based royalty distribution
- Automated compliance checks

### Provenance Tracking
- Complete ownership history
- Transaction record verification
- Exhibition and display history
- Restoration and maintenance logs
- Certification authority signatures
- Location and storage tracking

### Fractional Ownership Marketplace
- Real-time price discovery

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core contracts:
- ArtworkNFT.sol: ERC-721 implementation for artwork tokens
- FractionalShares.sol: ERC-20 tokens for shared ownership
- ProvenanceRegistry.sol: Records ownership and history
- AuthenticationOracle.sol: Manages verification processes
- MarketplaceController.sol: Handles trading operations
```
